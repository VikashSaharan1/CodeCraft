# Average Marks
You are given the marks obtained by a student in five different subjects: **Mathematics (M) , Science (S), English (E), History (H)**, and **Computer Science (C)**.
The marks for each subject are integers in the range from 0 to 100 (both inclusive).

Write a program that takes the student's name (as a single character) and the marks for each subject as input.
Calculate the average of the given marks (rounded down to the nearest integer) and print it along with the student's name.

### Input:
- The first line contains a single character representing the student's name (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C', etc.).
- The next line contains five integers separated by spaces, representing the marks obtained in Mathematics, Science, English, History, and Computer Science, respectively.
### Output:
- Print the student's name (single character) on the first line.
- Print the integer part of the average marks (rounded down) on the second line.
### Example:


#### Input:
A
81 81 81 33 63
#### Output:
A
68
#### Constraints:
- Marks for each subject lie in the range 0 to 100 (both inclusive).
